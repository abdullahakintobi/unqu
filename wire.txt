the unqu wire protocol
--------------------

there's message header for a unit of communication:
   <protocol version (for debug and rate limiting)>

there's an enumeration of commands: each command is 1 byte
	commands {
		.LIST
		.KILL <pid: 4 byte>
	}

there's message frame as a unit of communication:
	<message header> (1 B)
	<command> (1 B)
	[command args]
	<end byte: 0x44> (1 B)
